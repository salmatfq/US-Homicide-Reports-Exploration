# US Homicide Reports: Exploration & Visualization

The data used in this project is a courtesy of the Murder Accountability Project. 
This dataset contains murders from the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report as well as from the Freedom of Information Act's data on more than 22,000 homicides. 
It is an interesting dataset to study as it includes the sex, age, race of both the victims and the perpetrators, the location (city and state) of the crime, in addition to the type of weapon used, and the relationship between the victim and the murderer. 
Let's dive into a visalization of the gruesome American homicide scene and answer questions such as: what weapons are preferred by certain types of perpetrators? Who are female perpetrators most likely to murder?...
